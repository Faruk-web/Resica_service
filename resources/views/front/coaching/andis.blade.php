                        <p>The NDIS is the new way of providing support and funding to an estimated 500,000 Australians, under the age of 65, who have permanent and significant disability. A permanent disability means the disability is likely to be lifelong. A significant disability is one that has a substantial impact on a participantâ€™s ability to complete everyday activities. The new system is designed to provide participants with support to enable them to live independently. This is done by the provision of assistance and / or products that help a participant in their daily life, as well as helping them to participate in the community and reach their goals.</p>

            <p class="text-white mt-3" style="font-size: 18px;">
                The NDIS provides funding directly to eligible individuals. As a result, as an NDIS participant, you identify the support you need in your daily life, as well as what help you need to reach your goals. It also means you choose the NDIS provider you want to work with you. Your first step is to develop a NDIS plan. Your plan will be all about you and your goals and needs. It will provide a lot of detail about the supports you will be funded for. In addition, it will also list the amount of funding you will receive for each of these supports. Once your NDIS plan is approved, it will run for 12 months before being reviewed. If you require significant change to your plan, it will be reviewed earlier.
